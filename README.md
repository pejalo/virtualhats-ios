You can virtually wear one of the hats sold at their live shows.

## Requirements

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

## Installation

```
pod install
```

## Dependencies

Face detection is handled by [Google's Mobile Vision](https://developers.google.com/vision/) SDK, based on this [sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/ios-vision).

For future reference, these articles may help when replacing Google's Mobile Vision with native Cocoa APIs:
